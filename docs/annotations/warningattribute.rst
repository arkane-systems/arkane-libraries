.. index:: WarningAttribute

    [Warning (string reason)]

The warning attribute is an active attribute that causes a compiler warning to be reported for the attached piece of code during compilation.

Note: if warnings are treated as errors, the *WarningAttribute* will actually prevent successful compilation.
